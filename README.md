## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt more on regular expressions and its methods.

```JS
const regexTest = /^\w+([\.-]?\w+)*@\w+([\.-]?\w+)*(\.\w{2,3})+$/;
```

### Continued development

Development on html, css and js still needed.

### Useful resources

A lot of resources was helpful not just in this project but from the beginning of my learning of web development.

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com)

- [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com)

- [youtube](https://www.youtube.com)

- And lots more. Surely, I will always recommend them days in and days out
